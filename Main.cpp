	// b.Can you add another third function that has the same name and has two arguments : multiply(int, int)
	// and call it as follows multiply(2, 3) ? Why or why not? Add your answer as a comment in your code. (1 pt.).

	// ANSWER:
	// Yes, I am able to add another third function that has the same name and has 
	// two arguments: multiply(int, int) and call it as follows multiply(2, 3).
	// This is because the other multiply function with 2 arguments is a double and has 2 doubles
	// while this function uses 2 ints. This allows the compiler to differentiate between the 2 functions.
